# theriac-website

This repository contains the source code for Theriac's web development project. The project includes various HTML pages, CSS styles, and JavaScript scripts.

**Getting Started**

The first assignment on site measurements remained proactive and responsive, although less information was highlighted.
However, it had the following features:
**Accessibility**
**HTML Structure**
**Navigation**
**Responsive Design**
**Performance**
**Reference List**

The second assignment includes all the necessary information about the site's objective as a retail company.

**Dropdown Menus**: Each page includes a dropdown menu for easy navigation.
**Product Listings**: Each product page displays detailed information about the product, including images and prices.
**GitHub Integration**
**Content Organisation**
**Testing**: I've emphasised the importance of testing your website across different devices and browsers to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
**Documentation**: We've discussed the importance of documenting your code and project for future reference and collaboration.
**Version Control**: We've talked about using Git for version control, including committing changes, pushing to GitHub, and using branches.
**Feedback and Improvement**: We've mentioned seeking feedback from peers or instructors to improve your project.
